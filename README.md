 Emoji Picker with Emotion Verification

A web application that uses facial expression detection to verify whether a user's actual emotion matches the emoji they select. Features both Python backend (using OpenCV and DeepFace) and JavaScript frontend for maximum accuracy.

Project Description
An over-engineered web application that uses your webcam to see if you're faking your emotions. It cross-references your real-time facial expression with the emoji you select, ensuring complete emotional transparency whether you want it or not.
The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today's digital world, emoji fraud is rampant. People send a smiley face üôÇ while feeling dead inside, or an angry face üò† when they're just mildly annoyed. We're tackling the global crisis of emotional inauthenticity by forcing users to prove they genuinely feel the emoji they send.
The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We present the Emoji Picker with Emotion Verification! This revolutionary tool uses not one, but two complex facial recognition systems to call you out on your emotional dishonesty. Simply pick an emoji, make the face, and our state-of-the-art "Truth-o-Meter" will tell you if you're a "Great match" or a dirty liar ("‚ùå Mismatch").

Caption: The application's architecture. The frontend first attempts to communicate with the Python Flask backend via a REST API for high-accuracy emotion detection. If the backend is unavailable, it automatically falls back to the in-browser TensorFlow.js model for processing.
